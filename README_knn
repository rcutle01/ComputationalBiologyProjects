This program classifies gene expression samples by using the k nearest neighbors
algorithm. For varying inputs of k, it classifies genes based on the Euclidean
distance between data points. It then prints out the projected class as either a
0 or a 1.

How to Run/Compile:
python k_nearest.py <Test sample> <training sample> -k <k value>
        - To get the values for the t-test, uncomment out the tTest function and
          comment the nearest_neighbor function

Approx time to run: 3-4 minutes
