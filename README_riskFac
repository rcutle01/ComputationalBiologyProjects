This program calculates the risk factor based on the inputted dempgraphics for
HIV, coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes within the U.S.
It reads in the four given files, creates 4 separate lists for each
disease/virus, walks through the list and calculates the risk factor for the
user's demopgraphics by adding up the risk factor from each catagory (for
example, male, asian, age 46). If the user is a member of a particular risk
group, such as obesity, then the program outputs suggestions to help lower the
user's risk. For a detailed description of the program, calculations for the
risk factor and a full reference sheet, see the written report.

How to compile/run:
python riskFactor.py hiv_data heart_disease stroke_data diabetes_data
